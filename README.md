# Portfolio – Aurel Šugarek

## About the Developer
I’m Aurel Šugarek, a junior full-stack developer in progress with a strong curiosity for secure web experiences. My learning path blends Harvard CS50 coursework, self-directed full-stack study, and daily capture-the-flag practice to sharpen both engineering fundamentals and a security-first mindset.

## Project Overview
This portfolio showcases the projects, skills, and ongoing learning journey that shape my transition into professional software development. The site highlights:
- Hero and About sections tuned to communicate my story and goals.
- A curated project gallery outlining technical stacks and key takeaways.
- Skills in progress, emphasising hands-on experimentation across frontend, backend, and AI tooling.
- A contact form connected to Formspree for mentorship, internship, or collaboration opportunities.
